If this happens, and there is a proper legal basis for providing your personal information, we will provide it to the party asking for it.<br>
<br>

<br>
We take the security of your personal information very seriously. We have put in place technology and security policies which are designed to protect the personal information that we hold about you. These cover storing, using and releasing any information you have provided, and preventing unauthorized access or use. We have put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures against unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal information and against accidental access, disclosure, alteration, loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal information. These include internal reviews or our data collection, storage, processing and destruction practices. We take steps to ensure the reliability of our personnel and subcontractors.<br>
<br>
We use an internal self-assessment program to verify that this privacy policy is accurate, comprehensive, prominently displayed, implemented and accessible. The self-assessment program also is used to indicate that this privacy policy conforms to the Privacy Principles and that we have in place procedures for training employees in its implementation, disciplining employees for failure to follow it and periodically conducting objective reviews of compliance with the foregoing.<br>
<br>

You can ask to see information we hold about you (with some exceptions). If you would like a copy of your personal information, you should contact our data privacy officer.<br>
<br>
c) Keeping information up to date<br>
<br>
We limit our collection of personal information to that which is relevant for the intended business and legal purposes for which it is to be used. We do not use the personal information in a way that is incompatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take steps to ensure that personal information is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete and current.<br>
<br>
7 – What to do if you have a complaint or concern<br>
<br>
We (a) provide procedures for verifying that our commitments to adhere to the Privacy Principles have been implemented; (b) undertake obligations to remedy problems arising out of a failure to comply with the Privacy Principles; and (c) provide independent recourse mechanisms so that each individual's complaints and concerns regarding our handling of personal information under the Safe Harbor Program can be investigated and resolved and damages awarded where the applicable law or private sector initiatives so provide.<br>
<br>
We are committed to resolving any privacy concerns that you may have. If you have any concerns or complaints about the way we’ve handled your personal information, please contact our data privacy officer. We’ll try to resolve the complaints directly with you, if we can, but if we can’t we will cooperate with all appropriate regulatory authorities.
